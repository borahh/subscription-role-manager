## 4. Assigning Roles to Product Variations

In the **Variations** window of your WooCommerce product, you can assign a role to each variation. When a customer purchases a subscription, their user role will automatically change to the role mapped to the variation they select.

- Ensure the **Subscription** checkbox is checked for the product variation.

## Important Notes
