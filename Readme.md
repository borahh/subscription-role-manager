4. In the “Variations” window, you can assign a role to each variation. When someone purchases a 
subscription, the plugin will automatically change the user role, mapped to the variation he 
purchases. Make sure “Subscription” checkbox is checked though.

NOTE: There is a restriction on the roles, which are displayed on the plugin settings. This is to avoid 
misconfiguration and security issues. Currently the default WordPress roles, as well as the roles 
associated with Yoast SEO are excluded from all the settings associated with this plugin
